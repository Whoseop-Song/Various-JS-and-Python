Increasing the voltage gradually suppresses overscreening in favor of the crowding of counterions in a condensed inner layer near the electrode.

First, the structure of the adsorbed electrolyte is partly modified. Second, dramatic differences are observed for the dynamics of the system during transient regimes. In particular, upon application of a constant applied potential difference, the increase in the temperature, due to the Joule effect, associated with the creation of an electric current across the cell follows Ohm?s law, while unphysically high temperatures are rapidly observed when constant charges are assigned to each carbon atom.},

The {IL} exhibits a multilayer structure that extends 20−30 Å from the electrode surface. The composition and ion orientation in the innermost layer were found to be strongly dependent on the electrode potential. While at potentials near the potential of zero charge ({PZC)}, both cations and anions adjacent to the surface are oriented primarily perpendicular to the surface, the counterions in first layer orient increasingly parallel to the surface with increasing electrode potential. A minimum in {DC} observed around −1 {VRPZC} (potential relative to the {PZC)} corresponds to the point of highest density of perpendicularly aligned {TFSI} near the electrode. Maxima in the {DC} observed around +1.5 and −2.5 {VRPZC} are associated with the onset of “saturation”, or crowding, of the interfacial layer. The asymmetry of {DC} versus electrode polarity is the result of strong interactions between the fluorine of {TFSI} and the surface, the relatively large footprint of {TFSI} compared to pyr13, and the tendency of the propyl tails of pyr13 to remain adsorbed on the surface even at high positive potentials. Finally, an observed decreased {DC} and the disappearance of the minimum in {DC} near the {PZC} with increasing temperature are likely due to the increasing importance of entropic/excluded volume effects (interfacial crowding) with increasing temperature.},

All three {RTILs} show strong interfacial layering, starting with a cation layer at the substrate and decaying exponentially into the bulk liquid. The observed decay length and layering period point to an interfacial ordering mechanism, akin to the charge inversion effect, which is suggested to originate from strong correlations between the unscreened ions.

The electric double layer ({EDL)} structure and differential capacitance ({DC)} of {pyr13FSI} was compared with the results of the previous study of a similar {RTIL} pyr13bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ({pyr$_{13}$TFSI)} with a significantly larger anion [ Vatamanu, J. ; Borodin, O. ; Smith, G.

Instead, a 30\$0 higher {DC} was observed on the negative electrode for {pyr13FSI} compared to {pyr$_{13}$TFSI.} The larger {DC} observed on the negative electrode for {pyr13FSI} compared to {pyr$_{13}$TFSI} was associated with two structural features of the {EDL:} (a) a closer approach of {FSI} compared to {TFSI} to the electrode surface and (b) a faster rate (vs potential decrease) of anion desorption from the electrode surface for {FSI} compared to {TFSI.} Additionally, the limiting behavior of {DC} at large applied potentials was investigated. Finally, we show that constant potential simulations indicate time scales of hundreds of picoseconds required for electrode charge/discharge and {EDL} formation.},

In this model, called molecular dynamics electronic continuum ({MDEC)}, the electronic polarization is treated explicitly in terms of the electronic continuum ({EC)} approximation, while the nuclear dynamics is described with a fixed-charge force field. In such a force-field all atomic charges are scaled to reflect the screening effect by the electronic continuum. The {MDEC} model is rather similar but not equivalent to the standard nonpolarizable force-fields; the differences are discussed. Of our particular interest is the calculation of the electrostatic part of solvation energy using standard nonpolarizable {MD} simulations. In a low-dielectric environment, such as protein, the standard {MD} approach produces qualitatively wrong results. The difficulty is in mistreatment of the electronic polarizability. We show how the results can be much improved using the {MDEC} approach. We also show how the dielectric constant of the medium obtained in a {MD} simulation with nonpolarizable force-field is related to the static (total) dielectric constant, which includes both the nuclear and electronic relaxation effects. Using the {MDEC} model, we discuss recent calculations of dielectric constants of alcohols and alkanes, and show that the {MDEC} results are comparable with those obtained with the polarizable Drude oscillator model. The applicability of the method to calculations of dielectric properties of proteins is discussed.},

  abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulations are a valuable tool to study
	the mechanisms that dominate the properties of ionic liquids (ILs)
	on the atomistic and molecular level. However, the basis for any
	molecular dynamics simulation is an accurate force field describing
	the effective interactions between all atoms in the IL. Normally
	this is done by empirical potentials which can be partially derived
	from quantum mechanical calculations on simple subunits or have been
	fitted to experimental data. Unfortunately, the number of accurate
	classical non-polarizable models for ILs that allow a reasonable
	description of both dynamical and statical properties is still low.
	However, the strongly increasing computational power allows one to
	apply computationally more expensive methods, and even polarizable-force-field-based
	models on time and length scales long enough to ensure a proper sampling
	of the phase space. This review attempts to summarize recent achievements
	and methods in the development of classical force fields for ionic
	liquids. As this class of salts covers a large number of compounds,
	we focus our review on imidazolium-based ionic liquids, but show
	that the main conclusions are valid for non-imidazolium salts, too.
	Insight obtained from recent electronic density functional results
	into the parametrization of partial charges and on the influence
	of polarization effects in bulk ILs is highlighted. An overview is
	given of different available force fields, ranging from the atomistic
	to the coarse-grained level, covering implicit as well as explicit
	modeling of polarization. We show that the recently popular usage
	of the ion charge as fit parameter can looked upon as treating polarization
	effects in a mean-field matter.},

  abstract = {Ionic liquids are of high interest for the development of safe electrolytes
	in modern electrochemical cells, such as batteries, supercapacitors
	and dye-sensitised solar cells. However, electrochemical applications
	of ionic liquids are still hindered by the limited understanding
	of the interface between electrode materials and ionic liquids. In
	this article, we first review the state of the art in both experiment
	and theory. Then we illustrate some general trends by taking the
	interface between the extremely pure ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium
	tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate and an Au(111) electrode
	as an example. For the study of this interface, electrochemical impedance
	spectroscopy was combined with in situ STM and in situ AFM techniques.
	In addition, we present new results for the temperature dependence
	of the interfacial capacitance and dynamics. Since the interfacial
	dynamics are characterised by different processes taking place on
	different time scales, the temperature dependence of the dynamics
	can only be reliably studied by recording and carefully analysing
	broadband capacitance spectra. Single-frequency experiments may lead
	to artefacts in the temperature dependence of the interfacial capacitance.
	We demonstrate that the fast capacitive process exhibits a Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman
	temperature dependence, since its time scale is governed by the ionic
	conductivity of the ionic liquid. In contrast, the slower capacitive
	process appears to be Arrhenius activated. This suggests that the
	time scale of this process is determined by a temperature-independent
	barrier, which may be related to structural reorganisations of the
	Au surface and/or to charge redistributions in the strongly bound
	innermost ion layer.},

	on the (100) surface of a metallic aluminum electrode is studied
	by molecular dynamics simulations. The transition causes a sharp
	peak in the potential dependence of the differential capacitance
	of the interface. This result is in qualitative agreement with recently
	reported experimental work on the interface between a room temperature
	ionic liquid and a well-defined Au(100) surface. In the LiCl/Al simulations,
	the transition occurs when the interaction model includes the induction
	of dipoles on the ions of the liquid by their mutual interaction
	and their interaction with the electrode surface as well as the polarization
	of the metal by the charges and dipoles on the ions ("image" interactions).
	When the electrode or ion polarization effects are not included,
	the transition is no longer observed. The interaction between the
	induced charges on the metal atoms and the induced dipoles on the
	ions creates an additional screening, which stabilizes the formation
	of a crystalline layer at the anode. When the crystallographic plane
	of the metal is changed to (110) instead of (100), the two first
	adsorbed layer are crystalline on both the anode and the cathode,
	but the structure is different: the crystal is formed through an
	epitaxial mechanism to adapt to the electrode surface structure.
	In the case of the (110) crystallographic plane, the charging of
	the adsorbed layer occurs through the formation of nonstoichiometric
	crystalline layers.},

	built of freestanding single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundles
	are suitable for scalable integration into devices and nanocomposites
	for many applications. The superior properties of these films, such

	flexibility, result not only from the outstanding properties of individual
	SWCNTs but also from the collective behavior of the individual tubes,
	with additional properties arising from the tube-tube interactions.
	In this review, the synthesis, structure and fundamental properties,
	such as conductivity, transparency, optical nonlinearity and mechanical
	performance, of "freestanding SWCNT bundle network" thin films and
	nanocomposites, as well as their application as supercapacitors are
	highlighted. Some long-standing problems and topics warranting further

	abstract = {Ionic liquids ({ILs)} represent a fascinating, and yet to be fully understood, medium for a variety of chemical, physical and biological processes. Electrochemical processes form an important subset of these that are particularly of interest, since {ILs} tend to be good electrochemical solvents and exhibit other properties which make them very useful as electrolytes in electrochemical devices. It is important therefore to understand the extent to which electrochemical reactions and processes behave in a relatively "normal", for example aqueous solution, fashion as opposed to exhibiting phenomena more uniquely the product of their organic ionic nature. This perspective examines a range of electrochemical reactions in ionic liquids, in many cases in the context of real world applications, to highlight the phenomena as far as they are understood and where data gaps exist. The important areas of lithium and conducting polymer electrochemistry are discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {Salts having a low melting point are liquid at room temperature, or even below, and form a new class of liquids usually called room temperature ionic liquids ({RTIL).} Information about {RTILs} can be found in the literature with such key words as: room temperature molten salt, low-temperature molten salt, ambient-temperature molten salt, liquid organic salt or simply ionic liquid. Their physicochemical properties are the same as high temperature ionic liquids, but the practical aspects of their maintenance or handling are different enough to merit a distinction. The class of ionic liquids, based on tetraalkylammonium cation and chloroaluminate anion, has been extensively studied since late 1970s of the {XX} century, following the works of Osteryoung. Systematic research on the application of chloroaluminate ionic liquids as solvents was performed in 1980s. However, ionic liquids based on aluminium halides are moisture sensitive. During the last decade an increasing number of new ionic liquids have been prepared and used as solvents. The general aim of this paper was to review the physical and chemical properties of {RTILs} from the point of view of their possible application as electrolytes in electrochemical processes and devices. The following points are discussed: melting and freezing, conductivity, viscosity, temperature dependence of conductivity, transport and transference numbers, electrochemical stability, possible application in aluminium electroplating, lithium batteries and in electrochemical capacitors.},

	abstract = {Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors, store energy using either ion adsorption (electrochemical double layer capacitors) or fast surface redox reactions (pseudo-capacitors). They can complement or replace batteries in electrical energy storage and harvesting applications, when high power delivery or uptake is needed. A notable improvement in performance has been achieved through recent advances in understanding charge storage mechanisms and the development of advanced nanostructured materials. The discovery that ion desolvation occurs in pores smaller than the solvated ions has led to higher capacitance for electrochemical double layer capacitors using carbon electrodes with subnanometre pores, and opened the door to designing high-energy density devices using a variety of electrolytes. Combination of pseudo-capacitive nanomaterials, including oxides, nitrides and polymers, with the latest generation of nanostructured lithium electrodes has brought the energy density of electrochemical capacitors closer to that of batteries. The use of carbon nanotubes has further advanced micro-electrochemical capacitors, enabling flexible and adaptable devices to be made. Mathematical modelling and simulation will be the key to success in designing tomorrow's high-energy and high-power devices.},

	abstract = {The nanoscale interactions of room temperature ionic liquids ({RTILs)} at uncharged (graphene) and charged (muscovite mica) solid surfaces were evaluated with high resolution X-ray interface scattering and fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. At uncharged graphene surfaces, the imidazolium-based {RTIL} ([bmim+][{Tf2N?])} exhibits a mixed cation/anion layering with a strong interfacial densification of the first {RTIL} layer. The first layer density observed via experiment is larger than that predicted by simulation and the apparent discrepancy can be understood with the inclusion of, dominantly, image charge and π-stacking interactions between the {RTIL} and the graphene sheet. In contrast, the {RTIL} structure adjacent to the charged mica surface exhibits an alternating cation?anion layering extending 3.5 nm into the bulk fluid. The associated charge density profile demonstrates a pronounced charge overscreening (i.e., excess first-layer counterions with respect to the adjacent surface charge), highlighting the critical role of charge-induced nanoscale correlations of the {RTIL.} These observations confirm key aspects of a predicted electric double layer structure from an analytical {Landau?Ginzburg-type} continuum theory incorporating ion correlation effects, and provide a new baseline for understanding the fundamental nanoscale response of {RTILs} at charged interfaces.},

Bulk-modified electrodes as carbon paste electrodes with ionic liquid as binder and carbon nanotubes -- gel electrodes represent another two classes of reviewed electrodes. Electrodes modified with appended ionic liquid form the last group. Initially, research on ionic liquid-modified electrodes was oriented towards fundamental studies of ion transfer across ionic liquid/aqueous solution interface.
